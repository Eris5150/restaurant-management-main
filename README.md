## 🛠 Troubleshooting: Browser Didn’t Open Automatically?

## ❓ Browser Didn’t Open Automatically?

If the app didn’t open in a new browser tab, follow these steps:

### 1. ✅ Allow Pop-ups for Gitpod

Sometimes your browser blocks Gitpod from opening the app automatically.

#### On Chrome:
- Click the 🔒 icon in the address bar
- Select **"Site settings"**
- Under **"Pop-ups and redirects"**, choose **Allow**
- Refresh the page

Or go to:  
chrome://settings/content/popups
Add: 
[*.]gitpod.io

### 2. 🌐 Open the App Manually

If it still doesn’t open:

- In Gitpod, click the **PORTS** tab (bottom right)
- Look for **port 8080**
- Click the **🔗 link or globe icon** next to it — your app will open in a new tab

Example URL:  
https://8080-<your-workspace-id>.gitpod.io/
